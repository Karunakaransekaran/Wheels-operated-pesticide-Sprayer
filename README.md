**Wheels Operated Pesticide Sprayer**

A manually powered, wheel-driven pesticide sprayer designed as a low-cost alternative to conventional motorized systems. The unit converts wheel rotation into pump actuation, generating continuous spray pressure without fuel, electricity, or manual hand pumping. It is suitable for small and medium-scale farms requiring a reliable and easy-to-maintain spraying solution.

**Project Overview**

The device operates by using the rotational motion of its wheels to drive a reciprocating pump via a cam or crank mechanism. As the operator pushes the sprayer forward, the pump delivers continuous pressure to the spray nozzles. This ensures uniform pesticide distribution, reduced operator effort, and minimal chemical exposure. The system uses a lightweight steel frame, durable wheels, an adjustable handle, and a chemical-resistant tank. Multiple nozzles can be mounted for increased coverage width.

**Key Features**

No fuel or electricity required

Wheel-driven reciprocating pump

Continuous and uniform spray output

Low operating and maintenance cost

Multiple nozzle support for wider coverage

Simple fabrication suitable for student projects and rural applications

**Working Principle**

Wheels rotate as the operator pushes the unit.

A linkage (cam or crank mechanism) converts rotation into pump stroke motion.

The pump pressurizes the pesticide stored in the tank.

Pressurized pesticide flows through hoses to spray nozzles.

Nozzles atomize the fluid and distribute it uniformly.

Spraying, pumping, and movement happen simultaneously.
